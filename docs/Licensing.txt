We (the authors) provide PHEET under a variety of licenses depending on the 
usage scenario.

By default, we provide PHEET under the terms of LGPL 3 or later.

If you need to use PHEET under the terms of a license incompatible with 
LGPL 3 or later, please contact the authors for permission.

Please be aware that we also provide versions of PHEET including contributions 
licensed under the terms of LGPL 3 or later or GPL 3 or later. If you need to 
use those contributions with PHEET under a different license, you need to 
contact the contributors for permission.

Contributors should decide on one of the following licenses:
- Boost Software License - Recommended for small contributions.

	or a contributor license agreement (CLA). This allows us to provide

- LGPL 3 or later - Allows us to use your code in GPL and LGPL licensed 
	versions of	PHEET, but we have to exclude your code when publishing it
