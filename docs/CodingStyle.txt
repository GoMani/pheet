Standard Directories:
short lowercase names
Each should contain a sub.mk file (except for header-only directories)

CamelCase starting with an upper-case letter (should be same as class name
or part of the class name)
Everything required for using the class should be contained within
Header file to include should have the same name as the class
Optional readme file describing the class

Directories providing a concept implemented by multiple classes:
CamelCase starting with an upper-case letter
Readme file describing the concept and guarantees given
Each implementation is a subdirectory

Header files:
Use #ifndef guards to make sure they are only included once

Source files:
lower-case name (CamelCase for classes)
