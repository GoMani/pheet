Provides a circular array that may be used by other data-structures.

T get(size_t i)
Thread safe. Retrieves an element at a given index.

void put(size_t i, T element)
Only thread-safe if it is guaranteed that no concurrent grow operation is issued

void is_growable()
Checks whether the array can be grown further. There might be an upper limit on growth, or some implementations might even provide a fixed size

void grow(size_t bottom, size_t top)
Grows the array. Allows for concurrent get operations to be issued, but is otherwise not thread-safe.
May only be grown if array is_growable
